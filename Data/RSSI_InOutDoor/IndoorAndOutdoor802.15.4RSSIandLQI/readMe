RSSI (AND LQI) MEASUREMENTS

In all the measurements, when the nodes were equipped with the external antenna (EXT ANT) we took into account its gain.
Instead we do not know the pattern of the integrated antenna (INT ANT).
To estimate the channel parameters K and eta we use the following equation

P_rx = P_tx + K_d0 - 10*eta*log10(d/d0)

where P_tx = -1 [dBm], d0 is the reference distance to be in far field condition (10 [cm] in our studies) and P_rx [dBm], i.e. the RSSI samples, is the received power (already adjusted according to the Tmote sky RSSI offset and, if necessary, the external antenna gain).

RSSI samples collected from a couple of nodes, one in central position and the other ringing around that.

rssi_c (360x3x23): the nodes (INT ANT) were kept at the same orientation rotating the outer node with the central node.
rssi_d (360x3x23): the central node (INT ANT) was kept stationary while the second (INT ANT) ringed around it.
rssi_a (360x3x23): the central node (EXT ANT) was kept stationary while the second (INT ANT) ringed around it.

10 samples for every position (0:10:350[degree], 20:10:240[cm])
rssi_x(:,1,j) = degree/10 
rssi_x(:,2,j) = RSSI nodeA-->nodeB
rssi_x(:,3,j) = RSSI nodeB-->nodeA
distance between tx and rx: (j*10+10)[cm]

We wanted to observe the effects of averaging the RSSI samples over TIME or over FREQ.
